  abstract={Natural disasters often have high economic costs, setting back years of investment in developing countries. This paper develops a multi-sector DSGE model to study the macroeconomic and welfare implications of financing resilience-building using different fiscal instruments. The model includes developing countries’ macroeconomic and distributional features, such as a large unproductive rural sector, an incomplete credit market, and an informal sector. The results indicate that investing in resilience capital in a disaster-prone country improves welfare despite its high economic cost, but the financial instrument used to mobilize revenue matters.},

  abstract = {This paper examines the macroeconomic implications of information frictions within a quantitative business cycle model. We develop a general solution method that allows enriching a standard medium-scale DSGE model with dispersed information.
We estimate the model using Bayesian methods, incorporating comprehensive macroeconomic and expectation data, and revisit crucial questions about business cycles. Expectations data identifies strong information frictions, which dampen general equilibrium effects and change the relative importance of various shocks in driving business cycles. We find that information frictions complement standard inertial frictions rather than being alternatives. The former is crucial for generating sluggishness in inflation, whereas the latter is important for inertia in real macroeconomic aggregates.},

  abstract = {Firms' inflation expectations vary systematically across industries. We study the determinants and macroeconomic implications of such heterogeneity. Theoretically, we develop a rational inattention model of price-setting firms within a production network. In equilibrium, firms' inflation forecast accuracy depends on their attention to industry-specific marginal costs and how informative marginal costs are about aggregate inflation. Heterogeneous inattention arises endogenously, determines sectoral price rigidities, and compounds downstream in the production network. At the macroeconomic level, the interaction between the production network and endogenous inattention alters the aggregate effects of monetary and productivity shocks. Empirically, we combine comprehensive data on US firm-level inflation expectations with industry-level information and find that upstream industries and those with more volatile productivity shocks have significantly less accurate inflation forecasts. Our calibrated model replicates these empirical patterns.

  month = {November},
  year = {2025},

  abstract = {Households hold "supply-side" views, in which higher expected inflation is associated with lower growth and higher unemployment. Using data from the Michigan Survey of Consumers, I document that this supply-side view strengthens significantly with age: 75-year-olds expecting worse economic conditions forecast inflation 1.5-2 percentage points higher than 18-year-olds. I extend the Malmendier-Nagel learning-from-experience framework to a multivariate setting where households jointly learn about inflation and real activity dynamics from lifetime observations. Constructing cohort-specific experience-based expectations using historical U.S. data from 1872, I show that the model captures observed age variation in subjective economic models. The findings suggest that the 1970s stagflation persistently shaped older cohorts' beliefs.
